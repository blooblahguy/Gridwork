# Communication
- Be concise. No emojis. Single-line lowercase comments in code.
- Implement only what's requested. Extend existing systems over creating new ones.
- Do not create documentation or usage examples unless requested.

# Code Quality
- Prefer editing existing code over creating new files/abstractions
- Keep solutions simple and focused on the current task
- Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
- Don't design for hypothetical future requirements
- Follow domain driven design
- Keep files roughly single responsibility

# Error Handling
- Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees
- Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen
