# Cursor Rules

Place all rules in `.cursor/rules/` with `.mdc` extension and kebab-case names.

## File Structure
```
---
description: Brief purpose
globs: optional/path/**/*
alwaysApply: false
---
# Title

Concise content. No redundancy with other rules.
```

## Guidelines
- `alwaysApply: true` only for rules needed in every prompt
- Keep rules short to reduce token cost
- Avoid overlap between rule files
