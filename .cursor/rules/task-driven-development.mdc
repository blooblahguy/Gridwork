# Task-Driven Development

For large features, break down before coding:

1. **PRD First**: Clarify requirements, research approaches, define success criteria
2. **Task Breakdown**: Create TASKS.md with priorities (P0-P3) and dependencies
3. **Incremental Build**: Start with highest priority/lowest dependency. MVP first.
4. **Track Progress**: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, DONE

```markdown
# TASKS.md Example
## P0 - Core
- [ ] Research existing patterns
- [ ] Design data structure
- [ ] Implement basic loading

## P1 - Integration
- [ ] Integrate with existing systems
- [ ] Test functionality
```
